# Serve Command Documentation

The `serve` command starts a FastAPI web server that provides both a web interface and HTTP API for text-to-speech generation.

## Basic Usage

```bash
uvx pocket-tts serve
# or if installed manually:
pocket-tts serve
```

This starts a server on `http://localhost:8000` with the default voice model.

## Command Options

- `--voice VOICE`: Path to voice prompt audio file (voice to clone) (default: "hf://kyutai/tts-voices/alba-mackenna/casual.wav")
- `--host HOST`: Host to bind to (default: "localhost")
- `--port PORT`: Port to bind to (default: 8000)
- `--reload`: Enable auto-reload for development

## Examples

### Basic Server

```bash
# Start with default settings
pocket-tts serve

# Custom host and port
pocket-tts serve --host "localhost" --port 8080
```

### Custom Voice

```bash
# Use different voice
pocket-tts serve --default-voice "hf://kyutai/tts-voices/jessica-jian/casual.wav"

# Use local voice file
pocket-tts serve --default-voice "./my_voice.wav"
```

## Web Interface

Once the server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the web interface.

For more advanced usage, see the [Python API documentation](python-api.md) for direct integration with the TTS model.
